# Hack-Squad
**Levi Ryan**

I plan to make the Sugar Sugar-esque thing I described on Wednesday







**Jacob Wasserman**

Not sure what I want to do:

1. Create a wave motion of particles and click on it to create ripple effect
2. Click to explode particles
3. Waterfall of particles till screen is full








**Nicolas Urruchi**

My idea is to have the mouse hold a bomb and every time I click, the bomb will fall and when it lands at the bottom of the screen, it would explode into different colors.
