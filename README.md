# Hack-Squad

**Note: I don't yet have a screenshot of any merge conflicts, so I cannot turn in Milestone 2 just yet.**


**Levi Ryan**

I plan to make the Sugar Sugar-esque thing I described on Wednesday

Milestone 1: I'm doing Part B


Merge conflict time UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH



**Jacob Wasserman**

Not sure what I want to do:

1. Create a wave motion of particles and click on it to create ripple effect
2. Click to explode particles
3. Waterfall of particles till screen is full

Milestone 1: Part D

Milestone 2: Part D





**Nicolas Urruchi**

My idea is to have the mouse hold a bomb and every time I click, the bomb will fall and when it lands at the bottom of the screen, it would explode into different colors.

Milestone 1: A

Milestone 2: A

**Wei Wang**

I don't know if its a good idea, but I thought of making fireworks or like a statue or things that crumbles to dust when clicked.
Milestone 1: Part C
